wireless earphone!!DAMN!!

okay so i go through the whole thing (spent a lot of time here seeing if anything meant anything), alot of verification and things i didn't get but then i see the few vol up and down with plays and pauses!!

that's interesting, cuz that's something that can related to fidgeting on the ear pods

so there's alot of them but in sets so i got confused
