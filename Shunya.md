wireless earphone!!DAMN!!

okay so i go through the whole thing (spent a lot of time here seeing if anything meant anything), alot of verification and things i didn't get but then i see the few vol up and down with plays and pauses which i conntrolled by this protocol called AVRCP so i filter it out!!

that's interesting, cuz that's something that can related to fidgeting on the ear pods

so there's alot of them but in sets so i got confused

sorted them in a doc. Could be morse where the play is a pause and vol up is `_` and vol down is `.`

yep!! it's that

it comes out as `-... .-.. . / ..-. - .--`
